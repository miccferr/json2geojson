# pointless
An **almost** pointless CLI tool to convert Overpass API JSON into valid GeoJSON.  

## Installation
```git clone``` the repo.
```npm install``` the dependencies.

## Usage
```json2geojson``` from bash, then provide the explicit paths of the files you want to convert/create


***Soon to be availble as a ```npm```package.!***
